Virtual Pet Simulator
Virtual Pet Simulator is a Java-based application where users can adopt and take care of a virtual pet. The application allows users to interact with their pet by feeding, playing, grooming, and putting it to sleep. The pet's well-being is determined by the user's actions, and the application provides real-time updates on the pet's status.

Pet Care Actions: Feed, play, groom, and sleep to take care of your pet.
Real-Time Status Updates: View your pet's health, happiness, hunger, and energy levels.
User Interaction: Interactive GUI for performing care actions.
Save and Load Functionality: Save your pet's status and load it later to continue playing.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language used to develop the application.
Java Swing: GUI library for creating the graphical user interface.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilized for designing and implementing the virtual pet and its behaviors.
